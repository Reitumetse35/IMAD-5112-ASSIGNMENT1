this app provieds a meal suggestion based on the time of day, the user needs to add the time of the day in oder to get a meal idea for the day
this app  consists of a textView2 ( display suggestions) which tells the user what to eats
e.g when user types in breakfast a breakfast meal appears 
when user type lunch ,a cerain meal appears
when user type dinner ,a certain meal shows up 
it also contains a editText,this will let the user enter the time of the day
i decied to add the imageView so my app looks  more appealing 
i added a reset button and a submitbutton 
once the user types in time of day the user should then click the submit button for the display suggestion to show the time of the day 
when user clicks the reset button the app goes back the to the message "display suggestion"
the first textView is to tell the user what the app is about
